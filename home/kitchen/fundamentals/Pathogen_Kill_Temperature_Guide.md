# Pathogen Kill Temperature Guide

## 1. Core Principle: Temperature + Time

Pathogens are not killed by temperature alone --- they are destroyed
based on the combination of:

> **Temperature × Time**

Higher temperatures kill microorganisms faster, but lower temperatures
can also kill them if held long enough.

This concept is known as **Thermal Death Time**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Why 100°C Is NOT Required to Kill Pathogens

Many people believe that food must reach 100°C (boiling point of water)
to be safe.\
This is a misunderstanding.

### Reality:

Most harmful bacteria die at temperatures well below 100°C.

Examples:

-   55°C → bacteria die slowly (several minutes)
-   60°C → die faster
-   63--65°C → die quickly
-   70°C+ → die very rapidly
-   100°C → instant destruction of most bacteria (but not all spores)

Therefore:

> Food safety does NOT require boiling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Pasteurization vs Sterilization

### Pasteurization

-   Makes food safe to eat
-   Kills most harmful bacteria
-   Does NOT kill all microorganisms
-   Often done below 100°C

Example: - Milk pasteurization: \~72°C for 15 seconds

### Sterilization

-   Kills EVERYTHING, including spores
-   Requires much higher conditions
-   Often requires pressure

Example: - 121°C under pressure (autoclave / pressure cooker)

Important:

> 100°C does NOT guarantee sterilization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Why Some Spores Survive 100°C

Certain bacteria form **spores**, which are highly resistant survival
structures.

Spores can survive boiling water.

To destroy them:

-   121°C under pressure
-   Sustained exposure time

That is why pressure cookers are safer for certain foods.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Safe Internal Cooking Temperatures (General Guide)

  Food Type     Safe Internal Temperature
  ------------- --------------------------------
  Fish          63°C
  Beef steak    63°C (surface bacteria killed)
  Ground meat   71°C
  Chicken       74°C

These temperatures are sufficient to kill common pathogens when properly
reached internally.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Key Misunderstanding Explained

Misconception:

> "Only 100°C can kill pathogens."

Correct Understanding:

-   Most bacteria die below 100°C.
-   Safety depends on internal temperature and time.
-   Boiling is a simple but unnecessary rule for most meats.
-   Sterilization is different from making food safe to eat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Practical Takeaway

-   Measure internal temperature, not surface temperature.
-   Insert thermometer into the thickest part.
-   Follow recommended safe internal temperatures.
-   100°C is not required for safe cooking.
-   Pressure cooking is needed only for true sterilization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Food safety is about **controlled heat**, not extreme heat.
