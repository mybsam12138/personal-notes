# Why Water "Explodes" When It Meets Hot Oil

## 1. Core Principle

The violent reaction between water and hot oil is **not a chemical
explosion**.

It is a **rapid phase-change explosion** caused by:

> Instant vaporization of water into steam.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Key Temperature Difference

-   Water boils at **100°C**
-   Deep frying oil is typically **160--200°C**

When water contacts hot oil:

1.  Water rapidly heats to 100°C
2.  It instantly turns into steam
3.  Steam expands dramatically
4.  Expanding steam ejects surrounding oil

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Volume Expansion

When water turns into steam:

-   Liquid → Gas
-   Volume increases approximately **1,700 times**

This sudden expansion creates:

-   High localized pressure
-   Rapid displacement of oil
-   Violent splattering

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Why Water Sinks First

-   Density of water ≈ 1.0 g/cm³
-   Density of cooking oil ≈ 0.9 g/cm³

Water is denser than oil.

So when water enters hot oil:

1.  It sinks to the bottom
2.  Touches the hottest surface (the pan)
3.  Vaporizes instantly
4.  Steam forces oil upward

This is why splattering is so forceful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Why It Can Be Extremely Dangerous

If a large amount of water enters hot oil:

-   Massive steam generation occurs
-   Large amounts of oil are displaced
-   Oil can splash onto flames
-   Fire can spread rapidly

This is especially dangerous in grease fires.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Important Safety Rule

❌ Never pour water onto burning oil.\
✅ Instead: - Turn off heat - Cover the pan with a lid - Use a fire
blanket if available

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Summary

Water meeting hot oil causes a rapid phase-change reaction:

Hot Oil (High Energy)\
→ Water Instant Vaporization\
→ 1700x Volume Expansion\
→ Oil Displacement\
→ Violent Splattering

It is physics, not combustion chemistry.

Understanding this helps prevent kitchen accidents.
