# Home Cooking Doneness Guide

A practical guide to judge whether food is properly cooked and safe to eat.

# 1. The Four Ways to Judge Doneness

## 1️⃣ Visual Changes

Cooking changes food structure, which changes appearance.

### Meat
- Raw beef: bright red → Cooked: brown/gray exterior
- Chicken: pink → opaque white
- Juices run clear (not pink)
- Surface browning (Maillard reaction)

### Fish
- Translucent → opaque
- Flesh flakes easily with a fork

### Eggs
- Transparent whites → solid white
- Yolk thickens

### Vegetables
- Leafy greens collapse and soften
- Root vegetables become softer
- No raw-looking center

---

## 2️⃣ Texture Test

Use touch, fork, or knife.

### Meat
- Feels firmer when pressed
- Thick cuts: center should not feel soft and raw
- Tough cuts (after slow cooking): fork-tender

### Pasta / Rice
- No hard center
- Soft but not mushy

### Potatoes
- Knife slides in easily

## 3️⃣ Internal Temperature (Most Reliable for Safety)

Using a food thermometer is the safest method.

| Food Type        | Safe Internal Temperature |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Chicken          | 74°C (165°F)              |
| Ground meat      | 71°C (160°F)              |
| Beef steak       | 63°C+ (145°F+)            |
| Fish             | 63°C (145°F)              |
| Pork             | 63–71°C                   |

Temperature matters more than cooking time.

## 4️⃣ Smell

Cooked food should have:
- Roasted or savory aroma
- No raw metallic smell
- No sour or unusual odor

If smell is abnormal → do not eat.

---

# 2. Why Time Alone Is Not Reliable

Cooking time depends on:

- Thickness of food
- Starting temperature
- Heat intensity
- Cooking method
- Water content
- Altitude

Five minutes in one kitchen is not equal to five minutes in another.

# 3. Special Notes by Food Category

## Thin Foods
- Judge by appearance and texture.
- Usually cook quickly and evenly.

## Thick Meat
- Use thermometer.
- Outside may look cooked while inside remains raw.

## Seafood
- Cook briefly.
- Overcooking makes it dry and rubbery.

## Grains and Beans
- Ensure no hard core.
- Dense starch requires enough water and time.

# 4. Core Principle

Food is properly cooked when:

1. Harmful microbes are destroyed.
2. Protein structure has changed.
3. Texture is digestible.
4. Internal temperature reaches safe level.

# Practical Rule for Home Cooking

- Thin items → judge visually.
- Thick meat → use thermometer.
- Grains → check for soft center.
- If unsure → cook slightly longer rather than undercook (especially poultry).

Cooking is about structural change, not just time.
