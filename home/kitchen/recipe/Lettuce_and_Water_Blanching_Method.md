# Lettuce Overview & Standard Water Blanching Method

## 1. What is Lettuce?

**Scientific Name:** *Lactuca sativa*\
**Family:** Asteraceae (Daisy family)

Lettuce is a leafy vegetable cultivated primarily for its tender leaves.
It is a fast-growing annual plant and is closely related to other
members of the daisy family such as sunflower and dandelion.

### Key Characteristics

-   High water content (over 90%)
-   Thin, delicate leaf structure
-   Mild flavor
-   Very quick cooking time
-   Best suited for raw or quick heat applications

### Common Types

1.  **Iceberg Lettuce (Crisphead)** -- Dense and crunchy\
2.  **Romaine Lettuce** -- Elongated leaves, slightly firmer\
3.  **Leaf Lettuce** -- Loose and soft leaves\
4.  **Butterhead Lettuce** -- Tender and delicate

## 2. Why Lettuce Cooks So Quickly

Lettuce leaves:

-   Contain very little fiber compared to thicker vegetables
-   Have minimal structural density
-   Collapse rapidly when exposed to heat

Because of this, lettuce is not suitable for long boiling, stewing, or
braising.

# 3. Standard Water Blanching Method (Water Poaching)

Water blanching is the most common Asian preparation technique for
lettuce when served warm.

## Purpose

-   Lightly cook the leaves
-   Preserve color
-   Maintain texture
-   Remove raw bitterness

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Equipment Needed

-   Pot with water
-   Strainer or tongs
-   Optional: small amount of oil and salt

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step-by-Step Method

### Step 1: Bring Water to a Rolling Boil

Fill a pot with water and bring it to a full boil.

Optional: Add a small pinch of salt and a few drops of oil to enhance
color retention.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 2: Add Lettuce

Place washed lettuce into boiling water.

Do NOT cover the pot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 3: Blanch Briefly

Cook for:

-   10--20 seconds only
-   Stir gently to ensure even contact with hot water

Stop once the leaves:

-   Turn darker green
-   Soften slightly
-   Begin to collapse

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 4: Remove Immediately

Remove lettuce promptly using tongs or a strainer.

Drain excess water.

## Cooking Time Guidelines

  Lettuce Type   Blanching Time
  -------------- ----------------
  Iceberg        15--20 sec
  Romaine        15 sec
  Leaf Lettuce   10--15 sec
  Butterhead     8--12 sec

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Important Principles

-   Do not overcook
-   Do not simmer
-   Do not lid-cover during blanching
-   Keep the process fast

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Texture Goal

Properly blanched lettuce should be:

-   Tender but not mushy
-   Bright green
-   Slightly crisp at the stem
-   Moist but not waterlogged

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## When to Use This Method

-   As a light vegetable side dish
-   Paired with heavier foods (pizza, dumplings, fried dishes)
-   When a clean and mild flavor is desired

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Summary

Lettuce is a delicate leafy vegetable with high water content and
minimal structural density.\
The standard water blanching method emphasizes speed and control: brief
exposure to boiling water without covering the pot.

The key principle is:

**Quick in, quick out.**
