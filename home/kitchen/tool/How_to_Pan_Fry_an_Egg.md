# How to Pan Fry an Egg (Simple & Reliable Method)

## Equipment

-   Frying pan (non-stick preferred)
-   Cooking oil (about 1/2 teaspoon)
-   Spatula
-   Egg
-   Salt (optional)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 1: Preheat the Pan

-   Turn the heat to low or low-medium (about 30--40% of maximum).
-   Let the pan warm for 30--60 seconds.
-   Do not use high heat.

Proper heat should feel warm but not aggressively hot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 2: Add Oil

-   Add about 1/2 teaspoon of oil.
-   Tilt the pan so the oil forms a thin, even layer.
-   The surface should look lightly glossy, not flooded with oil.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 3: Crack the Egg

-   Gently crack the egg into the pan.
-   You should hear a soft sizzle, not loud popping.
-   If oil splashes or crackles loudly, the heat is too high.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 4: Cook the First Side

Cook without moving the egg.

### For Sunny-Side Up (Runny Yolk)

-   Cook 2--3 minutes.
-   White fully set.
-   Yolk still liquid.

### For Flipping (Over Easy / Medium / Hard)

-   Cook 2.5--3 minutes.
-   Ensure the white is fully set before flipping.

You should be able to gently slide a spatula underneath without tearing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 5: Flip Carefully (Optional)

To avoid breaking the yolk:

1.  Slide the spatula fully under the egg.
2.  Lift gently but confidently.
3.  Flip quickly in one smooth motion.

### Cooking Time After Flip:

-   20--30 seconds → Runny yolk (Over Easy)
-   45--60 seconds → Semi-set yolk (Over Medium)
-   1--2 minutes → Fully cooked yolk (Over Hard)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Alternative: No-Flip Method

If you prefer not to flip:

-   Cover the pan with a lid for 30--60 seconds.
-   Steam will cook the top while keeping the yolk intact.

This method reduces the risk of breaking the yolk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Heat Control Guidelines

Correct heat: - Gentle sizzling sound - No heavy splattering - No smoke

If the egg browns too quickly, reduce heat immediately.

Eggs cook by time and temperature control --- not by high heat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Oil Principle

Use enough oil to lightly coat the pan. You do not need visible pooling
oil. Eggs burn from excessive heat, not from oil drying out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Rule

Low, steady heat produces the best texture.

Cooking an egg is about patience, not power.
