# Monthly Household Electricity Cost Estimation (¥0.6 / kWh)

This document provides an **extended estimation of monthly household electricity costs**, including both **always-on devices** and **commonly used appliances**, assuming an electricity price of **¥0.6 per kWh**.

---

## Calculation Formula

- **Monthly energy (kWh)**  
  = Power (W) ÷ 1000 × Hours of use per month

- **Monthly cost (¥)**  
  = Monthly energy (kWh) × 0.6

---

## Always-On Devices

### 1. Smart Speaker (Standby)

- Typical standby power: **1–3 W**
- Monthly energy: **0.7 – 2.2 kWh**
- Monthly cost: **¥0.4 – ¥1.3**

---

### 2. Security Camera (24×7)

- Typical power: **3–6 W**
- Monthly energy: **2.2 – 4.3 kWh**
- Monthly cost: **¥1.3 – ¥2.6**

---

### 3. Wi‑Fi Router (24×7)

- Typical power: **5–12 W**
- Monthly energy: **3.6 – 8.6 kWh**
- Monthly cost: **¥2.2 – ¥5.2**

---

### 4. Refrigerator (24×7, intermittent compressor)

The refrigerator is usually the **largest constant electricity consumer** in a household.

- Typical range: **20 – 45 kWh / month**
- Monthly cost: **¥12 – ¥27**

Extreme cases:
- Small or high-efficiency models: **15 – 25 kWh** → **¥9 – ¥15**
- Old or inefficient models: **50 – 80 kWh** → **¥30 – ¥48**

---

## Frequently Used Appliances

### 5. Air Conditioner (Inverter Type)

Consumption depends heavily on room size, outdoor temperature, and usage time.

- Typical power while running: **800 – 1500 W**
- Example usage: **6–8 hours/day**
- Monthly energy: **120 – 300 kWh**
- Monthly cost: **¥72 – ¥180**

> Air conditioners are often the **largest electricity expense in summer**.

---

### 6. Washing Machine

- Typical power per cycle: **300 – 500 W**
- Energy per wash: **0.5 – 1.0 kWh**
- Typical usage: **12 – 20 cycles/month**
- Monthly energy: **6 – 20 kWh**
- Monthly cost: **¥3.6 – ¥12**

---

### 7. Electric Water Heater (Storage Type)

- Typical power: **1500 – 3000 W**
- Usage pattern: **intermittent heating**
- Monthly energy: **60 – 120 kWh**
- Monthly cost: **¥36 – ¥72**

---

### 8. Microwave Oven

- Typical power: **800 – 1200 W**
- Typical usage: **10 – 20 minutes/day**
- Monthly energy: **4 – 12 kWh**
- Monthly cost: **¥2.4 – ¥7.2**

---

### 9. Television

- Typical power: **80 – 150 W**
- Typical usage: **3 – 5 hours/day**
- Monthly energy: **7 – 22 kWh**
- Monthly cost: **¥4.2 – ¥13.2**

## Monthly Cost Summary (Typical Household)

| Category | Estimated Monthly Cost |
|--------|------------------------|
| Always-on devices | ¥6 – ¥12 |
| Refrigerator | ¥12 – ¥27 |
| Air conditioner | ¥72 – ¥180 |
| Washing machine | ¥4 – ¥12 |
| Other appliances | ¥10 – ¥30 |
| **Total (no AC)** | **¥30 – ¥80** |
| **Total (with AC)** | **¥100 – ¥250** |

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Air conditioners dominate electricity costs** during hot seasons.
- Refrigerators are the main contributor among always-on appliances.
- Smart devices and networking equipment contribute very little individually.
- Reducing AC usage or improving insulation yields the largest savings.

## How to Improve Accuracy

To estimate more precisely:
1. Use nameplate power ratings as upper bounds
2. Track daily usage hours for high-power appliances
3. Pay special attention to seasonal appliances such as air conditioners

Real-world electricity consumption is usually **lower than nameplate estimates** due to duty cycles and inverter technology.
