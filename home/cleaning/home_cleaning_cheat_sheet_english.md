# Home Cleaning Cheat Sheet (Practical & Safe Guide)

This document summarizes **how to clean different areas and materials in a home safely**, based on real household scenarios (move-in / wedding home / daily maintenance).

---

## 1. Core Cleaning Logic (Golden Rule)

> **Always choose the cleaning method by *type of dirt* and *material*, not just by room.**

- **Oil / grease** → alkaline or neutral cleaners
- **Water scale / limescale** → acidic cleaners (limited use)
- **Mold (fungus)** → kill first, then wipe, then dry
- **Uncertain or delicate surfaces** → neutral cleaners

---

## 2. Bathroom Cleaning

### Main dirt type
- Limescale (calcium & magnesium)
- Soap scum
- Urine scale

### Recommended
- **Acidic bathroom cleaner** (moderate use)

### Suitable areas
- Toilet bowl
- Sink
- Shower glass & tiles (short contact only)

### Avoid
- Natural stone (marble)
- Mixing with chlorine products
- Daily heavy acid use

---

## 3. Kitchen Cleaning

### Main dirt type
- Oil & food residue (organic)

### Recommended
- **Alkaline degreaser**
- Neutral cleaner for stone countertops

### Notes on stone countertops
- Most kitchen countertops are **quartz or artificial stone**
- **Do NOT use acidic cleaners** (vinegar, descalers, bathroom cleaners)
- Best option: **neutral cleaner or diluted dish soap**

---

## 4. Mold (Black Spots on Walls / Corners)

### What mold is
- Mold is **living fungus**, not dirt
- Wiping alone does NOT solve the problem

### Typical locations
- Wall corners
- Bathroom joints
- Window frames
- Behind cabinets

### Correct mold removal steps
1. Ventilate + wear gloves
2. Spray mold remover (or chlorine-based product)
3. **Wait 5–15 minutes** (do NOT wipe immediately)
4. Gently wipe away residue
5. Dry completely (airflow / fan / dehumidifier)

> **Drying is more important than cleaning to prevent recurrence.**

---

## 5. Cabinets, Doors, Handles

### Dirt type
- Handprints
- Dust
- Light grease

### Recommended
- **Diluted dish soap (neutral)**
- Microfiber cloth

### Method
- Slightly damp cloth
- Wipe surface
- Dry cloth to finish

> Rinsing with water is usually **not required** for cabinet panels.

---

## 6. Wooden Floors

### Key principle
> **Wood floors fear water more than dirt.**

### Daily cleaning
- Dry mop / vacuum
- Very lightly damp mop

### Deeper cleaning
- **Neutral wood-floor cleaner** (best)
- OR extremely diluted dish soap (occasional only)

### Important rules
- Mop must be **almost dry**
- Ventilate after cleaning
- For frequent soap use → rinse once with clean water

### Never use
- Acidic cleaners
- Strong alkaline cleaners
- Wet mopping or soaking

---

## 7. Sofa Cleaning (Very Important)

### Identify the material first

#### Fabric sofa
- Can use **very diluted dish soap**
- Dab gently, do not soak
- Rinse area lightly, then air dry

#### Leather / PU leather sofa
- **Do NOT use dish soap regularly**
- Use leather cleaner or slightly damp cloth
- Soap removes protective oils → drying & cracking

#### Tech fabric / synthetic leather
- Neutral cleaner or very diluted soap
- No scrubbing, no soaking

### Never use on sofas
- Bathroom cleaner
- Strong degreaser
- Alcohol (large areas)

---

## 8. Glass & Windows

### Best option
- **Glass cleaner + squeegee**

### Safe alternatives
- Water + tiny amount of dish soap

### Bathroom cleaner on glass?
- Only for **heavy limescale**
- Must rinse and dry immediately
- Not for regular glass cleaning

---

## 9. Minimal Safe Cleaning Kit (Recommended)

You only need **3–4 products**:

1. **Neutral cleaner / dish soap** (main tool – 70–80% tasks)
2. **Kitchen degreaser** (oil-heavy areas)
3. **Bathroom acidic cleaner** (limited use)
4. **Mold remover** (as needed)

Plus tools:
- Microfiber cloths
- Old toothbrush
- Dry mop / squeeze mop

---

## 10. One-Sentence Summary

> **Bathroom fights scale, kitchen fights oil, mold must be killed first, wood hates water, leather hates soap, and neutral cleaners solve most problems safely.**
