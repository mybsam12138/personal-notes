# Non-Performing Asset (NPA) Department in a Bank

## 1. Definition

The Non-Performing Asset (NPA) Department is a specialized unit within a
bank responsible for managing and recovering loans or financial assets
that are no longer generating expected payments.

An asset is classified as non-performing when the borrower has failed to
repay principal or interest for a specified period (commonly 90 days or
more).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Core Mission

The primary objectives of the NPA Department are:

-   Maximize recovery from defaulted loans
-   Minimize financial losses
-   Control legal and operational risks
-   Improve the bank's asset quality indicators
-   Support regulatory compliance

In simple terms, this department handles financial problems after loans
go bad.

A bank's financial health depends heavily on asset quality. High levels
of non-performing loans can:

The NPA Department plays a key role in maintaining financial stability
and protecting the bank's balance sheet.

unit. It steps in when borrowers default, manages legal and operational
processes, and works to recover as much value as possible while
maintaining compliance and minimizing risk.
