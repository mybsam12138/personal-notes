**Target reader:** Male, height **~170 cm**, everyday + travel + couple scenarios  
**Goal:** Look balanced, clean, and confident without overthinking outfits.

## 1. Core Dressing Principles (Universal)

### 1.1 Fit Beats Brand
- A well-fitted cheap outfit > an ill-fitted expensive one
- Avoid oversized tops and extra-long pants
- Shoulder seams must sit exactly on the shoulder

### 1.2 Vertical Lines Make You Taller
- Same or similar color top & bottom = longer silhouette
- Straight pants > skinny > wide (for 170 cm)
- Avoid strong horizontal color blocking

### 1.3 Contrast in the Right Direction
- **Light top + dark bottom** = taller & cleaner
- Avoid dark-heavy upper body unless very slim

### 1.4 Fewer Colors = More Advanced Look
- Ideal outfit: **1–2 main colors + 1 neutral**
- Too many colors shorten the visual height

## 2. Color Principles (Practical)

### 2.1 Safe Color System
- **Base neutrals:** Black, dark blue, dark gray
- **Soft lights:** White, beige, light gray, light khaki

### 2.2 What to Avoid at 170 cm
- High-saturation bright colors (neon, strong red)
- Large color contrast exactly at waist level

### 2.3 Best Color Formula
```
Light / neutral top
+ Dark pants
+ Simple shoes
```

## 3. Length & Proportion Rules (Critical for 170 cm)

### 3.1 Tops
- Jacket length: **mid-hip**, never below crotch
- Avoid longline coats unless tailored

### 3.2 Pants
- No stacking (fabric piling on shoes)
- Slight break or ankle-length is ideal
- Mid-rise waist preferred (low-rise shortens legs)

### 3.3 Shoes
- Clean sneakers or slim leather shoes
- Avoid bulky soles

**Goal:** Soft, warm, memorable
