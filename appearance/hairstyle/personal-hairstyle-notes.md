# Personal Hairstyle Notes & Haircut Communication Guide

This document records my **personal haircut preferences**, **basic hair physics understanding**, and **safe communication phrases** to use with a hairstylist.

Goal:  
A **clean, natural haircut** that looks good for **1 month**, requires **minimal styling**, and avoids irreversible mistakes.

## 1. My Hair Characteristics

- Hair type: straight, soft, easy to collapse
- Hair amount: sufficient (not thin), but heavy when overgrown
- Main issue:
  - Too much weight → collapses
  - Too little support → cannot stand

Key principle:
> Hair appearance is determined by **balance between weight, support, and friction**, not by length alone.

---

## 2. Overall Haircut Strategy (Current Visit)

### What I want
- Overall slightly shorter
- No drastic change
- Clean and natural
- Comfortable for work, holidays, and travel

### What I want to avoid
- Cutting too short
- Over-thinning
- Exposed scalp on the sides
- Aggressive or trendy styles

Core rule:
> Keep **80% of current shape**, adjust **20% for cleanliness**.

---

## 3. Length Control Rules

- Cut shorter, but **not too short**
- Hair should:
  - Look clean immediately
  - Look best after 7–10 days
  - Still look good after 1 month

Practical guideline:
- Remove about **10–15% length**
- Not a visible transformation

---

## 4. Side and Back Rules

- Sides:
  - Short, but **no visible scalp**
  - Clean outline without sharp contrast

- Back:
  - Clean neckline
  - Natural taper, not white fade

Key phrase:
> "Short but not skin-faded."

---

## 5. Top Area & Thinning Logic

### What thinning really means
- Thinning ≠ shortening overall length
- Thinning ≠ making hair strands thinner
- Thinning = **reducing internal hair density**

### Correct thinning behavior
- Done in **middle layers**, not outer surface
- Different positions, **1–2 cuts per area**
- Stop early and observe

### Why thinning must be light
- Too much hair → heavy → collapses
- Too little hair → no internal support

Correct state:
> Light, supported, and elastic

---

## 6. Hair Physics (Why Hair Collapses)

Hair shape depends on:
- Gravity (weight)
- Internal support (number of hairs)
- Friction between hairs

Results:
- Too dense → gravity wins → flat
- Too sparse → no structure → flat

Goal:
> Find the **stable middle zone**

---

## 7. Safe Communication Phrases (Recommended)

### One-sentence version
> "Slightly shorter overall, keep it natural.  
> Sides not skin-faded.  
> Light thinning on top only."

### If asked details
- Thinning:
  > "Just lightly, no over-thinning."

- Length:
  > "Clean, but not obviously shorter."

- Sides:
  > "Short, but no exposed scalp."

### Stop signal
> "This is enough, no need to thin more."

---

## 8. Haircut Tools Awareness

- Normal scissors:
  - Cut full length
- Thinning scissors:
  - Remove part of hair density
  - Must not be used repeatedly at same position
  - Should not touch outermost layer

Rule:
> Thinning scissors adjust **density**, not **length**.

---

## 9. Final Personal Rule

> A good haircut feels:
> - Light when touched
> - Stable when standing
> - Natural when seen
> - Forgiving when grown

If unsure:
> **Stop early. You can always cut more later.**
