# Quantitative Haircut Specification (Personal Use)

This document defines **exact hair lengths**, **tools**, and **clipper guard levels** suitable for my head shape, hair type, and style preference.

Goal:
Clean, natural, low-risk haircut that grows well for ~1 month and requires minimal styling.

## 1. Overall Principles

- Preserve natural softness
- Avoid exposed scalp
- Avoid over-thinning
- Maintain structure and internal support

Rule of thumb:
> Sides & back = clippers  
> Top = scissors

---

## 2. Quantitative Length by Head Area

### 2.1 Sides

- Target length: **1.2 – 1.8 cm**
- Ideal length: **~1.5 cm**
- Must NOT expose scalp

**Tool:**
- Clippers with guard

**Guard levels:**
- #4 → 13 mm (recommended)
- #5 → 16 mm (recommended)
- #3 → 10 mm (borderline, only if blended softly)

**Avoid:**
- #1–#2 (skin fade)
- Sharp contrast or white fade

---

### 2.2 Back / Nape

- Target length: **1.2 – 1.5 cm at lowest point**
- Gradual blend upward

**Tool:**
- Clippers + blend (clipper-over-comb or scissors)

**Guard levels:**
- #4 or #5 at base, blended naturally

**Avoid:**
- Hard lines
- Skin fade

---

### 2.3 Top

- Target length: **5 – 7 cm**
- Ideal length: **~6 cm**

**Tool:**
- Scissors only

**Why scissors:**
- Preserve structure
- Avoid flat, boxy effect
- Allow natural variation

**Avoid:**
- Clippers on top
- Uniform-length cutting

---

### 2.4 Front / Fringe

- Length: **same as top or slightly longer**
- Must allow natural parting

**Tool:**
- Scissors

**Avoid:**
- Blunt or straight-across cuts

---

## 3. Thinning (Density Control)

**Purpose:**
- Reduce internal weight
- Maintain external shape

**Amount:**
- Light thinning only
- ~10% density reduction

**Location:**
- Middle layers of the top only

**Tool:**
- Thinning scissors

**Rules:**
- Different positions
- 1–2 cuts per area
- Stop early and observe

**Avoid:**
- Thinning outer surface
- Repeated cuts at same height
- Thinning near scalp

## 5. One-Sentence Instruction (Safe Version)

> "Sides around 1.5 cm with clippers, not skin-faded.  
> Back clean but natural.  
> Top scissor-cut around 6 cm with very light thinning."

---

## 6. Final Rule

> A good haircut should feel light when touched, stable when standing, and natural when grown.

If unsure:
> **Stop early. You can always cut more later.**
