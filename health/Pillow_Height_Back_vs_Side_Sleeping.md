# cxPillow Height Guide: Back Sleeping vs Side Sleeping

This guide summarizes how to choose the **right pillow height** depending on **sleeping position**, with practical ranges and clear rules.

---

## 1. Core Principle

**Pillow height depends more on sleeping position than on gender.**

- **Back sleeping (supine)** and **side sleeping (lateral)** require **different pillow heights**.
- One single fixed height cannot perfectly suit both positions.

---

## 2. Back Sleeping (Supine Position)

### Goal
Support the **natural cervical (neck) curve** without pushing the head forward or letting the neck hang.

### What the pillow should do
- Fill the space under the **neck**, not lift the whole head
- Keep chin and airway in a neutral position

### Recommended height (compressed / real-use height)
- **8–10 cm**  
- Most adults are comfortable around **9–10 cm**

### Key factors
- Cervical curve shape
- Back of the head shape
- Mattress softness (minor effect)

### Common mistakes
- Pillow too high → neck flexion (like sleeping while looking down)
- Pillow too low → neck unsupported, morning stiffness

---

## 3. Side Sleeping

### Goal
Keep the **head, neck, and spine in a straight horizontal line**.

### What the pillow should do
- Compensate for **shoulder width and thickness**
- Prevent neck from bending downward or upward

### Recommended height (compressed / real-use height)
- **10–15 cm**
- Depends mainly on shoulder width and body build

### Key factors
- Shoulder width and thickness
- Mattress softness
- Body weight

## 4. Why Back and Side Sleeping Need Different Heights

| Sleeping Position | Main Structural Factor | Typical Height |
|------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| Back sleeping | Cervical curve | 8–10 cm |
| Side sleeping | Shoulder width | 10–15 cm |

**Difference:** usually **3–5 cm** for the same person.

---

## 5. Gender Differences (Important Clarification)

- Gender itself is **not a deciding factor**
- Differences come from **average body size**, not sex
- For the same sleep position:
  - Height difference is usually **≤ 1 cm**

---

## 6. “Universal” / Combination Pillows

These are designed to **support multiple sleeping positions**, usually by:
- Lower center (for back sleeping)
- Higher sides (for side sleeping)
- Or adjustable filling

### Pros
- Suitable for people who change positions
- Higher tolerance for height variation
- Good for couples

### Cons
- Not perfect for pure side sleepers
- Not as precise as position-specific pillows

---

## 7. Measuring Pillow Height (Correct Way)

Always measure **compressed height**, not labeled height.

### Correct methods
- Lie on the pillow and measure from mattress to head support point
- Or sit on the pillow for several seconds, then measure height

### Rule of thumb
- Actual height ≈ labeled height minus **2–4 cm** (depends on material)

---

## 8. Practical Recommendations

### If you mostly sleep on your back
- Choose a pillow with **9–10 cm compressed height**
- Prefer soft to medium firmness

### If you mostly sleep on your side
- Choose **10–15 cm compressed height**
- Shoulder width matters more than neck shape

### If you switch positions
- Use a **contoured or adjustable pillow**
- Prioritize your **main sleeping position**

---

## 9. Key Takeaway

> **Back sleeping and side sleeping require different pillow heights.  
A pillow should match your sleeping position, not just your body size.**
